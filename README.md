### API Settings

You'll need to have a working API and Secret key from whatever exchange you'll be using, with viewing **and** trading privileges. Exchanges typically require 2-Factor Authentication setup to be able to create keys.

When the bot asks you for the API key and Secret key, these are the two codes you'll want to feed it. All API keys are stored on your computer locally, so you'll only have to do this once.

### Instructions

Simply run the scripts using Python 3.7. There may be some differences between OSX or Windows; for example, `colorama` doesn't display color and style properly on Windows machines.

### Edits & Modifications

I'm hardly a certified "Python expert" or programming guru. If you feel something can be done better, feel free to bring up an **issue** or **pull request**, and I'll gladly take a look!
