### API Settings

You'll need to have a working API and Secret key from Bittrex, with viewing **and** trading privileges. To do this, you'll first have to set up 2-Factor Authentication from the Settings menu. 

- Click on *Settings* at the top once you are logged in on Bittrex. Go to the *Two-Factor Authentication* tab and setup 2FA.
- Go to the *API Keys* tab and click *Add New Key*. From here, you'll see that a new key will be added and you'll have to confirm this change using your authenticator code. 
- **Copy your secret key and store it, because once you click away from the page, _it's gone_.**  
- Be sure to turn on *READ INFO*, *TRADE LIMIT* and *TRADE MARKET* options. *WITHDRAW* isn't needed for the time being. 

When the bot asks you for the API key and Secret key, these are the two codes you'll want to feed it.

### Instructions

These bots are python scripts packaged as executables. To run them on either Mac or Windows, you only need to click on the app shortcut in the downloaded folder. This shortcut is linked to the proper executable within the source folder.

### Edits & Modifications

I'm hardly a certified "Python expert" or programming guru. If you feel something can be done better, feel free to bring up an **issue** or **pull request**, and I'll gladly take a look!
