### Credits

I want to thank Eric Somdahl for making my life exponentially easier with his Python API wrapper is nothing short of amazing. Most, if not all, of my bots use Bittrex scraping functions from Eric's package. Check it out: https://github.com/ericsomdahl/python-bittrex.

### Prerequisites

To use the Vavrespa Bittrex bots, you'll need to have Python 2.7 installed (3.6 versions are currently in the works). To download Python simply head over to the downloads section at Python.org, https://www.python.org/downloads/, and download the most recent version of Python 2.7 (as of December 8, 2017, Python 2.7.14 is the most up-to-date iteration). All functions used by the bots from external packages are embedded into the scrypt itself, so no need to install any other Python packages. <br/><br/>
To check that you have installed Python, open up Terminal or Command Prompt on type the following commands.

*Mac:*
```
python -V
```

*Windows:*
```
python
```

You should see your version of the Python language.

### API Settings

You'll need to have a working API and Secret key from Bittrex, with viewing AND trading privileges. To do this, you'll first have to set up 2-Factor Authentication from the Settings menu. You can then create new keys which you can enter into the bot when it asks you for the keys.
