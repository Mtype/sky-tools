### Credits

I want to thank **Eric Somdahl** for making my life exponentially easier with his Python API wrapper which is nothing short of amazing. Most, if not all, of my bots use Bittrex scraping functions from Eric's package. Check it out: https://github.com/ericsomdahl/python-bittrex.

### Prerequisites

To use the Vavrespa Bittrex bots, you'll need to have Python 2.7 installed (3.6 versions are currently in the works). To download Python simply head over to the downloads section at Python.org, https://www.python.org/downloads/, and download and install the most recent version of Python 2.7 (as of December 8, 2017, Python 2.7.14 is the most up-to-date iteration). All functions used by the bots from external packages are embedded into the script itself, so no need to install any other Python packages. <br/><br/>
To check that you have installed Python, open up Terminal or Command Prompt and type `python`.  You should see your version of the Python language. For example, the command line will return:
```
Python 2.7.14 (r264:75708, Sep 16 2017, 07:36:50) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for further information.
```
If you receive an error, you want to make sure that you have added Python as an environment variable, which is explained [here](https://edu.google.com/openonline/course-builder/docs/1.10/set-up-course-builder/check-for-python.html#add-to-path).

### API Settings

You'll need to have a working API and Secret key from Bittrex, with viewing AND trading privileges. To do this, you'll first have to set up 2-Factor Authentication from the Settings menu. You can then create new keys which you can enter into the bot when it asks you for the keys.

### Edits & Modifications

I'm an experimental physics and mathematics student, and hardly a "Python expert" or programming guru. If you feel something can be done better, feel free to bring up an **issue** or **pull request**, and I'll gladly take a look!
